# Notes and ToDo page

Web page to take quick notes and keep a todo list.
The notes and todo are saved in the browser's `localStorage`.
The notes can be saved to a file.

I blended this together from [SimpleMDE](https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor) and this [ToDo list](https://github.com/dwyl/javascript-todo-list-tutorial)
for my own use. 

One can also type in equations. It uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for this.
